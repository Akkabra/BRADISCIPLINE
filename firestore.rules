/**
 * @fileOverview Firestore Security Rules for Bra Discipline application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model. Each user can only access
 * their own data, which is enforced through path-based authorization.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * All data is nested under /users/{userId}, ensuring that user data is isolated
 * and access control can be easily managed through Firestore path matching.
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profile information.
 * - /users/{userId}/daily_routines/{routineId}: Stores daily routines for each user.
 * - /users/{userId}/journals/{journalId}: Stores journal entries for each user.
 * - /users/{userId}/focus_routines/{focusRoutineId}: Stores daily focus objectives.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only read and write their own user document and associated subcollections.
 * - Listing users is not allowed to prevent information disclosure.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * Path-based ownership is used to avoid the need for denormalization, as the `userId`
 * is already present in the document path.  No `get()` calls are needed to validate
 * ownership.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * All private user data is stored under the /users/{userId} path, ensuring it's kept separate from any potentially public data.
