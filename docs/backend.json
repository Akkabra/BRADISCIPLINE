    "reasoning": "This Firestore structure is designed to support user authentication and data storage for the 'Bra Discipline' application. It prioritizes authorization independence and clear access patterns.\n\n*   **/users/{userId}**:  Stores user profiles.  This enables path-based ownership, simplifying security rules (only the authenticated user can access their own profile).\n*   **/users/{userId}/family_events/{eventId}**: Stores planned family events. This nested structure ensures user ownership and simplifies security rules.\n*   **/users/{userId}/connection_tasks/{taskId}**: Stores family connection tasks. This subcollection also leverages path-based ownership for secure data access.\n*   **/users/{userId}/goals/{goalId}**: Stores user-defined goals. This subcollection also leverages path-based ownership for secure data access.\n*   **/users/{userId}/focus_routines/{routineId}**: Stores daily focus routines and goals. This subcollection uses path-based ownership for security.\n\n\n**Authorization Independence:**\n\nAuthorization independence is achieved through path-based ownership for all user-related data. This eliminates the need for `get()` calls in security rules to determine access, making rules more efficient and robust.\n\n**QAPs (Rules are not Filters):**\n\nThe structure supports secure `list` operations (QAPs) because all documents within a collection share the same security requirements. Listing data under a user's document is secure because the path inherently restricts access to that user's own data. The homogeneous security posture within each collection ensures that rules are not used as filters."
